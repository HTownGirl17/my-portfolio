          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            It's all about having a clean, eye-catching design. Not only do I
            provide that for the web, but I also strive for excellence in the
            print world too. I create logos, brochures, signs, etc. On the web,
            it's all about making sure sites are responsive to various devices
            with modern flare and attitiude.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Front-end development is my thing. I can build websites from scratch
            or manage existing websites to peak performance. I have experience
            with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React to name a few. Building out
            fast, interactive websites is the name of the game.

        Designer & developer based out of Houston, TX
      </p>
      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>
          I am an experienced communication professional who spent 13 1/2 years
          as a Radio Producer. I helped my co-workers with their technical
          problems and now I want to help others, too. I have spent my life
          working on computers, both Mac and PC computers. I got my start on
          creating websites when I was in high school. Before Facebook was
          around, I built my first website to show off images of things that I
          had done to my friends and family that lived far away. This lead me to
          a part-time job at an advertisting agency assisting in creating
          websites for businesses. Although I went a different direction after
          getting my bachelor's degree, website designing and developing was
          never far from my mind. I created a call manager for the radio station
          I worked for and a site for a doctor who hosts a talk show on the
          radio station.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now after completing a web development bootcamp and a React course on
          Udemy and soon to be graduating with an Associate of Applied Science Degree in Mobile/Web Application Development, I want to use the knowledge I have learned to create and manage websites for your business. I am a team player, organized, customer service oriented and a master at multitasking. My passion is for creativity. I find it exciting to explore new ways to create interactivity with the user. Learning new things is how we grow and evolve as people. I am dedicated to learning more and more about design and development which is why I am going for my master's degree in Computer Science. I hope my dedication will inspire you to hire for your next project.

She is an innovator,constantly learning and improving our work at the station. She would take on responsibilities and she would learn and teach us on the different aspects of the broadcast changes that had to be made. If we needed her for extra tasks, it was never a problem.
